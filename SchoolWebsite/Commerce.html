            <p>The exchange of commodities and services, particularly on a big scale, is what is meant by "commerce." It
                includes all systems that govern a nation or international trade, including those that are legal,
                economic, political, social, cultural, and technological.

                Some observers date the beginnings of business back to the first exchanges in the prehistoric era. In
                addition to traditional self-sufficiency, prehistoric people traded with one another for goods and
                services using the barter system, which was common at the time. Instead of paying with the
                later-developed monetary systems, one could obtain goods and services by offering the other person some
                other good or service in exchange. Peter Watson and Ramesh Manickam, historians, place the beginning of
                long-distance trade at around 150,000.</p>
