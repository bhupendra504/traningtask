                A wide range of human activities are included in the definition of art, including the production of
                visual, aural, or performing works of art that express the imagination, conceptual ideas, or technical
                prowess of the creator and are meant to be admired for their beauty or emotional impact. These endeavors
                include the creation of artistic works, the critique of artistic works, the study of artistic histories,
                and the distribution of artistic works for aesthetic purposes.

                Painting, sculpture, and architecture are the three traditional subfields of the arts. A broader
                definition of the arts includes literature and other forms of media including interactive media in
                addition to music, theater, film, dance, and other performing arts. Prior to the seventeenth century,
                there was no distinction between trades and sciences and art, which referred to any talent or expertise.
